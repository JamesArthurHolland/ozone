## Ozone

Ozone is a build pipeline management system, predominantly aimed at developers that work with docker / k8s.   

Ozone can:
 - manage environment variables at the top level, using composable blocks of dynamic environments that can be merged together.
 - build + run services (dockerfiles) as if they were on your localhost
 - ignore specified services, to use your IDE and debugger to interface with the services instead.
 - cache (ignore) directories that haven't changed since the last build, for faster build times.
