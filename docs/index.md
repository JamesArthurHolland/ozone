## Ozone

Ozone is a build pipeline management system, predominantly aimed at developers that work with docker / k8s.   

Ozone can:
 - manage environment variables at the top level, using composable blocks of dynamic environments that can be merged together.
 - build + run services (dockerfiles) as if they were on your localhost
 - ignore specified services, to use your IDE and debugger to interface with the services instead.
 - cache (ignore) directories that haven't changed since the last build, for faster build times.


### *Installation*

You will need the ozone daemon running, and also the ozone client.

#### *Daemon*
You can either:
##### Run from docker hub...
`docker run --user root --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -d -t -v /tmp/ozone:/tmp/ozone -p 8000:8000 --name ozone-daemon -listen=:8000 ozone2021/ozone-daemon:latest`
 TODO does ozone folder need created in TMP?
##### ...or build locally
`docker rm -f ozone-daemon; docker build . -t ozone-daemon --progress plain; docker run --user root --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -d -t -v /tmp/ozone:/tmp/ozone -p 8000:8000 --name ozone-daemon -listen=:8000 ozone-daemon`

The daemon runs on port 8000. This isn't open to configuration, as of yet.

The daemon is used to keep track of cache hashs to tell whether or not any runnable needs to run again.

`docker logs ozone-daemon -f` is a useful way to keep track on what's going on.

#### *Client*

Easy:   
`go get -u github.com/JamesArthurHolland/ozone/cmd/main`


# Getting started

Ozone is for making environment management easier. The best way to learn is by doing, so there is a test repo which we will also use for the tutorial.
```markdown
git clone git@github.com:JamesArthurHolland/ozone-test.git --recurse-submodules

cd ozone-test

# For linux
git checkout -b tutorial/1-simple-runnable-ubuntu; git submodule update

# For mac
git checkout -b tutorial/1-simple-runnable-macos; git submodule update
```
Docker's host network mode works on ubuntu but not on mac, so this is why the `NETWORK` is set to the project name in 
the mac version.

## 1. A simple runnable

The Ozonefile is supposed to be a full specification of how your project runs, including all of the environments.

Have you ever joined a team, tried to run the project locally, and it fails with some unhelpful message?

This is the bane of interpretated language developer's lives, and why I prefer golang to nodejs/ruby/python. 

More times than enough, this error is because of environment variables. Which don't exist on your fresh machine, due to 
the .env file the other developer is using not being checked in (.gitignore). Using ENV variables in code without checking their 
existence at program startup only compounds this already unadulterated chaos. Developers need to then read through code to find which 
ENV var they need to make it work. Future versions of Ozone will provide a startup bottleneck that checks for all the defined required variables 
before a program runs.

An Ozonefile decouples the environment providing mechanism (k8s secrets file / .env files) from the build command. In a 
similar fashion to GNU Make, the best practice for Ozonefiles is to create an "all" runnable. Runnables are similar to 
targets in Make.

##### Runnables have 3 types, and build in the following order:
1. builds
2. deploys
3. tests

The only thing that distinguishes the 3 types is their order of execution.

We can run:

`ozone r d-micro-a b-micro-a`

And the b-micro-a runnable will run first, as it is a build.

Run:

`ozone r all`

If you look at the Ozonefile, you will see that `all` will run the same runnables as the previous command.

The caching mechanism saved the combined hash of the Ozonefile and the given directory.

The "dir" and "service" attributes must be set for this to work.

Caching is only used for build stages, this is because the caching of environment variable files hasn't yet been 
implemented, so whenever variables are changed, the system cannot tell, so deploys are run each time to remedy this.

#### Status
`ozone s`
Shows the port service and port

#### Logs

Plans to multiplex logs in future, for now you can use the docker logs of the container. The container is named after 
service.

`docker logs micro-a -f`

## 2. Different contexts

```
# For linux
git checkout -b tutorial/2-different-contexts-ubuntu; git submodule update

# For mac
git checkout -b tutorial/2-different-contexts-macos; git submodule update~~~~
```

A context is similar to what normally developers would call "environments", however in Ozone, environments refer to 
blocks of environment variables. To distinguish between them, we have the term "context".

To view the current context,

`ozone c`

This will default to the defined default in the Ozonefile, if there is no context saved in memory in the daemon.

To set a different context:

`ozone c local-k8s`

This relies on you having a k8s cluster setup, with a docker registry running inside it, with the ingress address 
`registry.local` pointing at it.

Running `ozone r all` now, you will see the different context flash up.
